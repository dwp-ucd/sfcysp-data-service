            Dear Research Participant,<br>


            <P>

              You will reach State Pension age on 15 June 2023. Your current State Pension estimate is<br>
              <b>£176.49</b> a week. Your estimate is based on Your National Insurance record up to 5 April<br>2022.<br><br>

              Your forecast up to 5 April 2023 is <b>£185.15</b> a week.<br><br>

              Your forecast:<br><br>

              <p>You need <b>2 qualifying years</b> to increase your State Pension amount.<br><br>
              £185.15 a week is the most you can get.<br><br>

              <b>Ways to increase your State Pension amount</b><br><br>

              You can increase your State Pension amount by:<br><br>
            <div>
              <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-list">
              <li>working and making National Insurance contributions</li>

              <li>getting National Insurance credits if you cannot work because of unemployment,<br> illness, disability or caring for someone</li>

              </div>
            <br><br>

            <p>
            You have gaps in your National Insurance record that you may be able to fill by paying<br>
            voluntary contributions.<br>

            <br><br>

            <p>

              You can only pay for gaps from the last 6 tax years. You can also pay for future tax years if<br>
              you know you will not be making National Insurance contributions.<br><br>

                <b>    Undecided Years </b>

              <p>The following years are undecided on your National Insurance record:

              <p>2017 to 2018

              <p>This means these years have not been included in your State Pension estimate.<br>

                <p>You can contact His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to find out why there are<br>
              undecided years on your record. HMRC can tell you whether you can pay for these years<br>
              and how much it will cost.</p>
              <p>If you can pay for the undecided years, you could increase your State Pension estimate.</p>


                <p>  <b>Gaps in your National Insurance record</b><br><br>

                  The table below shows tax years with gaps in your National Insurance record during the last<br>
                  6 tax years. You can fill these gaps and make them count towards your State Pension. <br><br>

                  If you decide to pay for any of these years, we have included the amount your weekly State<br>
                  Pension estimate will increase by. <br><br>

                  You may be able to reach the maximum weekly amount by continuing to work and making<br>
                  National Insurance contributions. <br><br>
